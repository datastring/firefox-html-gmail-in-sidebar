# Basic HTML Gmail in Sidebar
## Notice: this addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org
A Firefox WebExtension to display the html-only version of [Gmail](https://gmail.com/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the html-only version of Gmail.

Press `Alt+Shift+G` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Telegram in Sidebar -> Options.

## More information about the HTML view

When you're in Basic HTML view, you won't see some Gmail features, including:

- Chat
- Spell checker
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Adding or importing contacts
- Custom "from" addresses
- Rich formatting

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Gmail on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Gmail in any way.
